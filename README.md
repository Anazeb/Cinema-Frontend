# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Component Division:
- The code is divided into pages (placed in page folder) which utilizes the components(placed in components folder.)
- Movie.jsx: This component is responsible for generating a list of links to booking pages for movie screenings. Each link displays the movie's title, poster image, and screening time.
The home page uses the screening list component.
- ScreeningList.jsx: This component groups movie screenings by date and renders a list of movies for each date, using the Movie component to display the details of each movie.
- formatMovieLength: This converts a movie's length from minutes to hrs and minutes.
- HomePage.jsx: This filters the list of movies based on the selected category and then renders the ScreeningsList component with the filtered movies.
- useScreenings.js: This fetches and filters screenings data from an API based on the movieId parameter in the current URL. It returns the filtered screenings data as a state variable.
